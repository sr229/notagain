# Ministruct

Ministruct is a heavily trimmed version of PAC3-Server's aowl to emulate as much of [Meta Construct](https://metastruct.net)'s environment as possible on local scenarios. 

This is useful if you want to test things before running it on their servers or you just want an extra spice on your local experience.

## Requirements

[Luadev](https://github.com/Metastruct/luadev) is required to run Ministruct otherwise there would be console errors (however aowl itself will remain functional, just that the lua development bits will not work).
